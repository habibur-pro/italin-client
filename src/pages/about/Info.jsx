          Going to Canada with a Job: When we open the pages of the newspaper,
          we see the flashy offer of a Job Visa for going to Canada. It includes
          drivers, nurses, physicians, engineers, domestic helpers, and
          gardeners. But it’s not as easy as they put in advertisements. It is
          quite impossible to go with some professions that the Canadian
          government doesn’t allow to issue LMO. If an applicant doesn’t have
          any training, educational qualification, and permit to live legally
          there, he/she can’t get an LMO or even go to Canada with a work
          permit. Because, if you try to enter Canada by using fake documents
          and visas, you have to go to jail before arrival in Canada. How it
          works (step by step): 1) The processing will be started with the
          employment agency of Canada as per the agreement with all of your
          documents such as academic certificates, job experience, birth
          certificate, national ID card, and photograph. If there is no
          agreement between that agency of Bangladesh (by whom you want to
          process and with whom you have deposited the money) and the employer
          of Canada, your dream won’t materialize. Your time and money will be
          lost in vain and you will be cheated. 2) The employment agency of
          Canada will arrange to produce 4 advertisements in their local
          newspapers to demonstrate to their government why they want to bring
          foreign workers from Bangladesh. It is a costly initiative and none of
          the Canadian employer will proceed to do it easily without their
          interest. 3) After giving the advertisement, the employment agency or
          employer will apply to HRSDC for approval of LMO with a local CV. If
          HRSDC understands after analyzing all aspects that it is reasonable to
          bring foreign workers by a Canadian company from Bangladesh, then they
          will issue an LMO mentioning several terms and conditions. LMO means
          Labor Market Opinion. 4) After the issuance of LMO, the Canadian
          employer will make an agreement with the employee in his/her own pad
          where the matters will be mentioned for which he/she has agreed and
          sent a joint agreement of 5/6 pages after signing on it. It will
          include LMO. There is a number at the top of LMO (7 digits) and you
          are welcome to our office of SA Associates to verify whether the
          number is genuine or not. Detailed information will be provided within
          48 hours. 5) After getting the LMO and Job Contract Paper, prepare the
          job letter from the local employer. Communicate directly with the
          local police station or DMP for the police clearance certificate. Keep
          available funds of a maximum of 8-10 lac in the bank statement. It is
          very necessary during the visa application. 6) If the following
          documents are prepared, get ready to submit a work permit application
          file in the VFS- Canada Dhaka office. (a) Passport (b) 2 copies 35×45
          photographs (c) Birth Certificate (d) Past and present job letter,
          appointment letter, salary certificate (e) NID Card (f) LMO & Contract
          Paper Original (g) Police Clearance Certificate Original (h) Bank
          Statement Original (in own name), (i) Job ID Card (j) Full set
          photocopy of passport from first to last (k) Any extra documents (l)
          Work permit application form CIC website (m) Family Information CIC
          website. It may take a minimum of few a months to get the visa. Take
          your passport yourself. Contact us. May your objective and interest be
          successful.
